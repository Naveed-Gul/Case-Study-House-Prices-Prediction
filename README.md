# Case Study: Case Study: Predicting House Prices Based on Various Features

### Description: 

This case study focuses on developing a predictive model that estimates the price of a house based on multiple features such as size, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors. Two machine learning models will be used: **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest.**

The goal is to create a model that can predict house prices with good accuracy based on the provided features. We will first prepare the dataset, explore the features, and then apply Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms to build predictive models.
